### Limitations 

1. Data quality and availability: The accuracy and completeness of the sales data may impact the reliability of the analysis.
2. Timeframe limitations: The analysis may only consider a specific timeframe, which might not capture seasonal fluctuations or long-term trends.
3. Lack of external data: The analysis only considers internal sales data, ignoring external factors like market trends, competition, and economic conditions.
4. Simplistic categorization: The analysis categorizes menu items into broad categories (e.g., Main Dishes, Starters), which might oversimplify the complexity of customer preferences.
5. No customer segmentation: The analysis treats all customers as a single group, ignoring potential differences in behavior and preferences across demographics, loyalty, or other segments.
6. Limited menu item analysis: The analysis focuses on top-selling and bottom-selling items but might not consider other factors like menu item profitability, inventory management, or supply chain optimization.
